### Titanic Survival - 02/09/15

Please see Kaggle Competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

>The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
>
>In this challenge, we were required to perform analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
